# How to contribute

1. Use a branch
Do not simply commit changes to the master branch, you must create a PR (github forces you)
2. Describe your commit well
'i changed someting and it does somting elser ish kinda ig maybe' is not helping anyone.
3. Unsure about a change? Make a pull request instead
PRs are there and should be used when needed. Even if you _could_ push directly, you should make a PR instead. to avoid code conflicting
