# How to contribute

1. Use a branch
Do not simply commit changes to the master branch, please create one for the change you're making
2. Describe your commit well
3. Unsure about a change? Make a pull request instead
PRs are there and should be used when needed. Even if you _could_ push directly, you should sometimes make a PR instead.
