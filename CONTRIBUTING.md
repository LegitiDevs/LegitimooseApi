## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions! Follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration:

1. **Create a Branch**  
Always work on a separate branch instead of committing directly to the `master` branch. GitHub will require you to create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes.

2. **Write Meaningful Commit Messages**  
Be descriptive and precise in your commit messages. For example, instead of:

i changed someting and it does somting elser ish kinda ig maybe

Aim for something like:

Fixed user authentication bug and improved API response handling


3. **Use Pull Requests (PRs)**  
If you're unsure about a change or its impact, create a PR for review. Even if you have push access, PRs help prevent conflicts and allow others to review and discuss changes.

4. **Review Guidelines**  
- Follow coding standards outlined in the repository (if available).
- Test your changes locally before submitting a PR.
- Be open to feedback and ready to make necessary adjustments.
